# SIZE -  Battery Comparison Tool

## Hassle free battery backup solutions, that just work.

SIZE is a web application for dimensioning electrical and physical characteristics of telecom battery units and evaluating their compatibility with factors entered in by site users. This tool is designed to ease the process of identifying and comparing products from various companies to help site owners find the perfect product to suit their backup power needs. 

For this brief I created a logo design, and a quick UI design in figma before going to code. During the development process I identified some areas where I could add additional content for not a large amount of time. 

Assets are from my current job at Polarium Energy Solutions AB, and some original assets.
